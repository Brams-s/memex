#   3. cargo build --release from this checkout -> $ROOT/bin/memex

Install memex yourself, then reinstall the plugin:
  brew install nicosuave/tap/memex
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${REPO}/main/scripts/setup.sh | sh
Or install a Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs) so this step can build from source.
